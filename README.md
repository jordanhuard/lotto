# Maine Lotto Hub

While reading Jordan Ellenberg's *How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking*, I was fascinated to learn about a few groups of people who invested in 
a Massachusetts State Lottery game and *actually made money*. That lottery game was pretty wild and doesn't exist anymore as a result, however I realized that 
the expected value of lottery tickets is often dependent on an increasing jackpot.

I also wanted to brush up on some Python skills and learn how to parse through HTML for important information, so I created this small project where the user 
can input which Maine Lotto tickets they bought and then see their expected winnings. Of course, the expected value of their winnings is largely inflated by the 
existence of a jackpot and other large prizes that the gambler is highly unlikely to win. Taxes on large prizes are also not taken into account. 

I do plan on revisiting this project soon and implementing a recent lotto ticket number checker as well as adding a menu to navigate between different features. 
While all of this information (besides the estimated ticket value) is available on the Maine Lotto site, this program provides a one-stop hub for Maine Lotto players.

To use this program, all that should be required is Python 3 and an internet connection.
